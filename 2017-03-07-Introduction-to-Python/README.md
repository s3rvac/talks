* [Lecturer and screen](https://video1.fit.vutbr.cz/index.php?record_id=43628&categ_id=1407)
* [Screen only](https://video1.fit.vutbr.cz/index.php?record_id=43629&categ_id=1407)

The recordings are from the second run (2017-03-08) because in the first run,
there were some technical difficulties with the screen.
